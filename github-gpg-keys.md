# How to add GPG keys to Github account
It is better to have different keys for each machine you access Github from.
In order to generate the keys, `gpg` or `gpg2` needs to be installed to the system.

The main benefit of having this enabled is the digital signing of commits and tags.

More detailed instructions can be found on the official pages [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account) and [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key).
